# 3D graphic engine!

<p>Java 3D engine for the JavaFX<br>Personal project, very proud with the result.<br>Author: Sergio Mart√≠ Torregrosa</p>
<p>The coded is based on the javidx9 (David Barr) YouTube series Code-It-Yourself 3D Graphics Engine. I have reimplemented the algorithms in java and add extra features what I have found in forums about this topic.</p>
<p>It works over the engine what tries to replicate the Pixel Game Engine of javidx9.</p>
